            It's been a while since our last conversation. This is my present from me unto you. <br>
            This past year, I tried to learn a lot of stuff, and programming is one of those things. <br>   
            This is my first project to make, hence why this is scuffed. <br>
            <br>
            I made this "website" as a gift, and a way to broaden my programming knowledge, <br>
            killing two birds with one stone. Again this is my first project, which means this  <br>
            would look like a glorified slideshow. Well regardless, I do hope you enjoy this gift.
