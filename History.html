                <p>Ahhh, Junel Martin Yape.</p>
                <p>The reason why I wanted to talk to you,</p>
                <p>was because of him. He called you a dog,</p>
                <p> I wanted to know why he called you that.</p>
                <p>Then, I saw your old profile pic......</p>
                <p> You were using a dog ears filter, you furry.</p>
            </div>
            <div style="background-color: #252e33;">
                <h1>Long Conversation I</h1>
                <p> We started chatting... a LOT</p>
                <p> I just wanted to get to know you,</p>
                <p> as a FRIEND! and I don't know how,</p>
                <p>  but that mission took a turn....</p>
                <p> and I became an infatuated teenager....</p>
            </div>
            <div style="background-color: #ffb866;"> 
                <h1>Ghosted</h1>
                <p>All was going well until you mentioned</p>
                <p>someone. I didn't ask who was him to you,</p>
                <p> because I don't want to pry in your personal</p>
                <p> life. I just assumed, and avoided you.</p>

                    <h1>Snowball</h1>
                    <p>I wanted to get rid of my emotions by</p>
                    <p>focusing on something else... someone...</p>
                    <p>else. Suprise, suprise! It didn't work, </p>
                    <p>and everything started to snowball and fall.</p>
                    <p>Eventually, I did learn how to supress it.</p>

                    <h1>Dark Times</h1>
                    <p>I call this as "Dark Times", because</p>
                    <p>there's nothing to see during this time. </p>
                    <p>We just continued our own separate lives.</p>
                    <p> You're happy, I'm happy. Everything </p>
                    <p>continued like nothing ever happend.</p>

                    <p>Everything was going well. Until the Festival! </p>
                    <p>I have no clue on how people started to</p>     
                    <p>notice me! They said I was too obvious, even  </p>
                    <p>though I know that I was acting the same </p>
                    <p>way.  Then, out of nowhere We just started </p>   
                    <p>talking again. Grade 9 was crazy.</p>

                     <p> I decided to not disturb you and I stoppped</p>
